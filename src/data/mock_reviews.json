Notion's AI pointed me to a feature that turned out to be nonexistent. So I reached out to the Notion team for advice on how to solve a very simple issue, given that there was no explanation in the support documentation and the AI hallucinated. It took a couple days for a specialist to get back to me. The answer was essentially: I can't give you a workaround, but you can pay for a specialist or ask the Notion community. Awful. I get better customer support from virtually every other SaaS company.",
